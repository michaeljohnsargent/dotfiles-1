#!/bin/bash

# This script will open all files from a git diff or a git show in vim.

# My bash skills are a bit primitive so this can probably be done more intelligently

# Usage:
#   git open -- opens all added files that have changed since HEAD
#   git open diff HEAD -- these are the default parameters
#   git open diff master -- opens files that have changed from master
#   git open show -- opens files that were changed in the last revision (HEAD)
#   git open show HEAD -- default param, does the same
#   git open show 4b3ca34 -- opens a particular REV

# It's set to use macvim as the default editor, you can change that easily by
# changing this line:
EDITOR=${EDITOR:-"$HOME/bin/mvim --remote-silent"}

COMMAND=diff
REV=HEAD

if [ $1 ]; then
    COMMAND=$1
fi

if [ $2 ]; then
    REV=$2
fi

if [ $COMMAND = "show" ]; then
    PARAM='--pretty=format: --name-only'
else
    PARAM='--name-only'
fi

#git $COMMAND $PARAM $REV | xargs $EDITOR
vim `git $COMMAND $PARAM $REV`
